### A library for multiple imputation of censored data.

This software performs multiple imputation on censored data using the probabilistic programming langauge Stan. 
The library fits a distributions to censored data and produces imputations based on the results.

How to use:

The data is assumed to have a normal distribution unless stated otherwise but there are options for the data to be uniform,t-distributed or exponential.Consider preprocessing using a power transform such as sklearn.reprocessing.power_transform before applying the algorithm.
